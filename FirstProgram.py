Hello Viewers,
Its a first program of a python

If you want to display a group of character in monitor.so I can use the print () Function 
We use double quotes and single quotes to deisplay a group of Character.

When the print function is called simply,it will throw the cursor to the next line it means that blank line will be displayed.

print('Today is the positive day..')

#print Variables list Statment

a,b = 2,3 # a is a variable and 2 is the value 

print(a) #without quotes we dsiplay a value to Stored by a variable a.
